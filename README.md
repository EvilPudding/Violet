# Violet

Violet is yet another open source entity-component framework.  Yes there are already plenty.  You should probably use one of those. The goal of this project is to not to build it better, faster, or stronger.  Rather, I just want to learn more about design patterns, code organization, and lower level systems like rendering and physics.


### Features

Rendering colored 2D polygons  
Rendering text  
Keyboard (A-Z) and mouse input  
Basic collision of 2D polygons  
JSON scene files  
C++ Scripting (can be reloaded at runtime)
